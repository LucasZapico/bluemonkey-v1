    title: Yoga of Words is an uplifting poetry and prose experience.
    summary: >-
       We created an experience that complemented our prose. Using warm minimalist design that feels welcoming but keeps the prose at the center of the experience.

      - branding
      - design direction
      - user experience design

    branding: >-
      We looked into various options for art and illustrations.  We needed something that complimented without either being ostentatious or overly opinionated. We settled on fine art illustrations of flowers. Flowers have enough symbolism for any prose theme while supporting the reading experience. 
    design: >-
      We created a minimalist reading experience where each piece is accompanied by a floral illustration. This allows the reader to focus on their relationship with the words. 
    development: >-
