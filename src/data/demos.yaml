    title: Yoga of Words is an uplifting poetry and prose experience
    summary: >-
      We started by exploring the idea behind Yoga of Words, what was the impact
      they wanted to share with the audience. We knew if we wanted to create
      something engaging, we needed to think on and compliment what a prose
      reading experience is. With this in mind, we created a refined digital
      presence that feels welcoming and keeps the prose at the center.
    deliverables:
      - website
      - branding
      - design direction
      - user experience design
      - web design
      - development
      - email design and automation
    branding: >-
      We looked into various art and illustrations that could compliment prose
      without either being ostentatious or overly opinionated symbolically
      thereby taking away from the prose. We settled on fine art illustrations
      of flowers as flowers have enough breathed of symbolism to match any prose
      theme while staying as a compliment not a distraction.
    design: >-
      We culminated in a minimalist reading experience where each prose is
      accompanied by a floral illustration allowing the reader to have a
      singular and completely curated relationship with the words. We enhanced
      the experience through email engagement with Mailchimp creating an
      automated branded welcoming email and automated weekly prose post updated.
    development: >-
      We used Gatsbyjs as our build framework, thus ensuring one of the fastest
      serving content.
