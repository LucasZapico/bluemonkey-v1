We settled on fine art illustrations of flowers as flowers have enough breathed of symbolism to match any prose theme while staying as a compliment not a distraction.",
      "design": "We culminated in a minimalist reading experience where each prose is accompanied by a floral illustration allowing the reader to have a singular and completely curated relationship with the words. We enhanced the experience through email engagement with Mailchimp creating an automated branded welcoming email and automated weekly prose post updated.",
